responsive website

MODULE 2:


The first thing that comes to our mind when we use the word “Responsive” in the context of websites is that it 
should be compatible with all kinds and sizes of devices. There is a constant demand in the industry to make every 
website responsive for better readability of the online contents in different environments.

APPLICATIONS:

1. The basic idea of this project is to make the MIS registration application responsive.
2. This would make the application, system independent and the students can use it through their mobiles as well.
3. This would justify the proximity of a wi-fi campus.
